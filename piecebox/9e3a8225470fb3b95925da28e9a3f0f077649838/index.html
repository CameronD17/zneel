			<p>Next is a good one, I hope you'll agree.</br>We go here a lot, the dogs, you and me.</p>
			<p>Though never on Thursday, so this might feel strange.</br>And not after eating, that's also a change.</p>
			<p>I think they do... pancakes? Oh man, this is hard!</br>We always just order what's first on the card.</p>
